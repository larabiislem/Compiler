# Compiler

Welcome to the **Compiler** repository!

## Overview

This project is a compiler implemented in C. It has been created by [larabiislem](https://github.com/larabiislem) and is publicly available at [larabiislem/Compiler](https://github.com/larabiislem/Compiler).

## Features & Functionality

This compiler includes several important modules and functionalities typically found in modern compilers:

- **Lexical Analysis (Lexer):**
  - Converts the input source code into tokens.
  - Handles whitespace, keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

- **Syntax Analysis (Parser):**
  - Builds a syntax tree (AST) from tokens.
  - Verifies the grammar and structure of the code.

- **Semantic Analysis:**
  - Checks for semantic errors such as type mismatches and undeclared variables.
  - Ensures correct usage of identifiers and operators.

- **Intermediate Code Generation:**
  - Translates the syntax tree into an intermediate representation (IR).
  - Serves as a bridge between parsing and code generation.

- **Code Generation:**
  - Produces target code (e.g., assembly or machine code) from IR.
  - Optimizes and emits executable instructions.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Reports syntax and semantic errors with meaningful messages.

- **Optimization (if implemented):**
  - May include techniques to improve performance or reduce resource usage.

> **Note:** These functionalities are based on typical compiler architecture and key search terms in the codebase. For implementation specifics, please check code comments and source files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC or another C compiler
- Make (optional, if a Makefile is provided)
- Basic knowledge of C and compiler concepts

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/larabiislem/Compiler.git
cd Compiler
```

### Building the Project

If a Makefile is present:
```bash
make
```
Otherwise, compile the main source file (replace `main.c` with your entry file):

```bash
gcc -o compiler main.c
```

### Running the Compiler

```bash
./compiler input_file
```

Replace `input_file` with the source code file you want to compile.
